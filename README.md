# Vox-Emotion-Detection

## Overview
Identifying emotion from speech is a non-trivial task pertaining to the ambiguous definition of emotion itself. In this work, I build light-weight multimodal machine learning models and compare it against the heavier and less interpretable deep learning counterparts. 

The approaches used to tackle the problem:

1. ML-based: Logistic Regression, SVMs, Random Forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting and Multinomial Naive-Bayes.
2. DL-based: Multi-Layer Perceptron, LSTM Classifier
